# Curate, Don't Consume

I recently participated in a discussion on what it means to be a web developer, and how to be successful in the community.  The group's mentor encouraged us to be curators of the web, not just consumers.

## What does it mean to be a Curator?

First we have to consider the opposing level of participation, being a consumer.  A consumer simply participates through the use of tools provided by others: APIs, data, libraries, etc.  Great projects can be created this way, but the real question is about value provided.  A curator applies theirs skills.

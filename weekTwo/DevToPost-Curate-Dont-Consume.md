# Curate, Don't Consume

I recently participated in a discussion on what it means to be a web developer, and how to be successful in the community.  The group's mentor encouraged us to be curators of the web, not just consumers.  The idea is important for beginners in search of what to do with the skills they are accruing.  Often do we get lost wondering what to do next, and usually get told the best way to learn is to start a project... period.  But what project?  Lets explore the mindset required to lead you to the next big idea.

## What does it mean to be a Curator?

First we have to consider what the opposite, being a consumer, means.  A consumer simply participates through the use of tools provided by others: APIs, data, libraries, etc.  Great projects can be created this way, but the real question is about value provided.  A consumer never moves beyond HackerRank, CodeWars, and Exercism.  

A curator applies theirs skills to bring value.  But to who?  This is were the hard truth for many beginners hits home.  Programming isn't a hobby in and of itself.  It is a skill which enhances other aspects of our lives.  Our projects should seek to meet a need in other communities which we participate.

## How do I find a project?

The answer is a question:  What do you enjoy doing, and what are you an expert in, other than programming?  Those communities in which you participate, more than likely, have a problem that can be solved with your programming skills.  If you can't find one, then rebuild something that already exists with your own approach.  

The mentor asked me what I was interested in other than programming.  The most significant of my many hobbies is homebrewing.  I struggled with coming up with an idea because, lets face it, its a common hobby among those who enjoy coding.  So I wrote a library of calculations needed for homebrewing.  Then I deployed it as an API.  Its unlikely anyone would call the API for the calculations, but they are able to pull the library from the repository.

Beyond the learning value, I attempted to provide something to the homebrewing technologist community and created a tool for further building.  That is the goal of a curator, to create something others can use.

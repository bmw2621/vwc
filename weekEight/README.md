# VWC - Block 2 - Computer Science
## Week 8

### Goals for Block 2

- Gain a better understanding of Recursion and how to implement it
- Understand Graph data structure and how to use it
- Build a repitoire of algorithms and when to apply

### Technical / Mathmatics Background

- Started undergraduate studies as a civil engineer, exposing me to a lot of math (mostly calculus, and 15 years ago so mostly attrified)
- A good deal of Python experience for data management / analysis
- Learned Object Orient Programming while learning Java (plan to have OCA Java certification by end of 2019)
- Work as a QA Manager and Performance Tester for a company with Java software

### Definition of Computer Science - Personal

> The study of how to harness the computational power of computers to perform tasks and calculations, repetively if necessary, to accomplish what would be impractical for humans to accomplish manually
